## Application Systemizer

 Systemize your App systemlessly!
 Using terminal emulator.
 Enter this command and choose the app you want to systemize.

or

	systemize -h
	
 And you will be presented with a list of installed apps.
 And Reboot to apply changes.

## Error?
 Go to the menu and type `logs`, this will upload the log files of this module and will generate a link. Send that :)
 Alternatively, Send `/data/local/tmp/terminal_debloater-verbose.log` in the XDA thread. I'll examine it for problems and will try to fix it.
